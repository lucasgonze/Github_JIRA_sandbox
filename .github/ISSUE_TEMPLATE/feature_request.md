We recently consolidated multiple channels that were used to file Feature Requests (FRs). In the spirit of improving the visibility of FRs, we believe it's best for them to be submitted through the [New Relic Issue Tracker](issues.newrelic.com). This single tool will enable better aggregation of FRs and improve our ability to synthesize requests and provide better value to our users.

**We welcome feature requests from our open source community through the [New Relic Issue Tracker](issues.newrelic.com).**

We recently consolidate multiple channels that were used to file Feature Request (FR).  In the spirit of improving the visibility of FRs, we felt that it's best for them to be submitted through [New Relic Issue Tracker](issues.newrelic.com). A single tool will enable better aggregation of FRs and improve our ability to consolidate requests and provide better value to our users. 

We continue to welcome feature request from our open source community through the [New Relic Issue Tracker](issues.newrelic.com).

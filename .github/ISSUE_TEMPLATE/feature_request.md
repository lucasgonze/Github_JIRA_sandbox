We have recently made a consolidation of the many channels used to file Feature Request.  In the spirit of improving our means of consolidating and having visibility on all FR in one tool, we felt that it's best for them to be submitted through (Issues Portal)[issues.newrelic.com]. A single tool will enable better visibility to these Feature Request and improve our ability to aggregate requests and get back to our users with a more complete picture. 

We continue to welcome feature request from our open source community through the issues.newrelic.com portal.
